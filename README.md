MtconnectTranspiler
======

This is an open source project focused on deserializing the SysML model for [MTConnect&reg;](https://mtconnect.org). The normative XMI provides a structure for the MTConnect&reg; standard. One of the goals of this project is to leverage this structure to automate the development of other MTConnect&reg;-related tools. For example, the structure and validation in the [`MtconnectCore`](https://github.com/TrueAnalyticsSolutions/MtconnectCore) project.

## Documentation
Any documentation surrounding MTConnect&reg; can be found on the [MTCup](https://mtcup.org/) site (MTConnect User Portal).

Any technical documentation surrounding MTConnect&reg; can be found on the [MTConnect&reg; Model Browser](https://model.mtconnect.org/) generated from the SysML model.
